## Architecture Design Documentation
### 1. High-Level System Architecture Diagram
The system architecture includes:
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Displays project and task management interfaces.
- **API Layer (Next.js)**: Handles backend logic and AI integration.
- **AI Engine (LLM APIs + TensorFlow)**: Manages tasks, provides feedback, and adapts learning modules.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores user, project, and task data.
- **GitHub Integration Service**: Tracks student activity on GitHub.
- **External Services (LLM APIs, Cloud Storage)**: Integrates with external APIs and cloud services.

### 2. Components Breakdown
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Built with Next.js and React.js for rendering UI and handling routing.
- **Backend (API Layer in Next.js)**: Manages authentication, API requests, and interfaces with AI and GitHub services.
- **AI Engine (LLM APIs + TensorFlow)**: Handles task management, performance feedback, and adaptive learning.
- **GitHub Integration Service**: Fetches and monitors GitHub activity.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores all user, project, and performance data.
- **External Services**: Integrates with LLM APIs, cloud services, and email/notification systems.

### 3. Data Flow and Interaction
